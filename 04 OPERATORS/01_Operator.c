1. What is Operator ?
- Operators are some special symbol who performs some special and meaningful operation. Like addition, multiplications


2. What does operators do ?
- Operator do some meaningfull opreations.
- Operator acts a very important role in progrmming.
- Because progrmming is all about mathematics and calculation, we need operator to perform those operations.

 

# There are mainly three types of operator available : its base on operents.  
- Unary - one operand (-, ++, --, !, &, sizeof)
- Binary - two operand
- Ternary - three operand



# What is Operand ?
- a + b --> here '+' is operator, a and b is operand


# Unary Operator : only have one operand. Ex: ++ --


# Binary Operators : Have two operand 
there are different type of Birnary operators avaiable
- Arithematic ( +, -, *, /, %)
- Relational (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- Logical (&&, ||, !)
- Assignment (= , +=, -=, *= , /=, %=)
- Bitwise (&, |, ~, ^, >>, <<)


# Ternary Opreator: have three operand. Example : conditonal operator
